# personal-budget

The idea here is to project a monthly income, deduct projected expenses, and then forecast how much balance would be left by the end of the month.

### Budget structure:
Monthly income, Envelope spending, Unbudgeted expenses, Projected taxes, and Balance Left.

### Budget variables:
id, value

### Envelopes: 
Housing, Eating out, Groceries, Savings, Pet care, Online purchases, Transportation, Insurance, and Health spending 

### Envelope variables:
id, name, value
